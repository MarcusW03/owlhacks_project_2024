      Finances are tricky for everyone. As a team of current first-generation low-income college seniors, 
      we understand this. Itâ€™s very daunting being the first in your family to try to build generational 
      wealth all while having a midterm on Monday. And donâ€™t get me started on the google search rabbit holesâ€¦ 

      To tackle this issue, **we want you to know youâ€™re not alone.** You can set yourself up for financial success 
      in high school by learning about credit cards and maybe even opening one. Credit cards should not be 
      scary. They can come with many benefits if used **responsibly** and we hope that this website can empower 
      you to see credit cards in a different light. 
      
      **ðŸ‘ˆ Select a module from the sidebar** to start learning about
      the world of credit!

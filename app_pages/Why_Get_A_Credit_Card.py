        ##### To answer this question, we first have to explain what a **credit history** is.

        The number of credit cards you have? Do you pay your credit card statements on time? 
        Have you taken out any loans? All of the answers to these questions are included on 
        your credit history. 
        
        This information is collected so that when you apply for loans 
        or a new credit card, businesses can make the decision if they want to let you take 
        out that loan or credit card (so you should pay your credit card on time!). And you 
        won‚Äôt have a credit  history if you‚Äôve never had a credit card before or haven‚Äôt 
        gotten a loan. 

        Your credit score is a number ranges from 300 to 850, with the 300s being ‚Äúbad‚Äù credit and 800s being ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù credit. 

        ##### FUN FACT: 
        By law, you can get a free credit report from each credit bureau from [AnnualCreditReport.com]({url})

        ##### Having a good credit history and score can help out in a variety of ways: 
        - You could get lower interest rates on loans (like mortgages and auto loans) 
        - You could increase your chances of being accepted for a loan 
        - You could be more eligible for better credit card rewards (like higher cash back rewards)
